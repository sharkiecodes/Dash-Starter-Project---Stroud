I consistently use the destructuring line 
{ store, collection } = this.props

TypeScript looks at the props object and extracts 
the store, and collection properties, creating three new variables store, and collection.


Often, e.stopPropagation was
Necessary to prevent the canvas from panning. Otherwise, for example, it interprets the selection of a different node type
as the mouse continuously being down / pressing or highlighting that box.


// NodeContentRenderer.ts

/**
 * A single function to return the "raw content" (no frame)
 * for any node type. This ensures we only maintain one switch,
 * used by NodeRenderer (when mode=ContentOnly) and by
 * CompositeNodeView if it wants to show child content directly.

      SCrapbook return <div>Unsupported node type {node.type}</div>;
      */
