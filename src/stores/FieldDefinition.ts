// FieldDefinition.ts
/**This interface provides a standard format for the properties each node store can have.
 * Each NodeStore has an array of fieldDefinitions 
 * which implement this interface.
 * 
 * Having a FieldDefinition in each NodeStore allows the NodeStore to contain
 * information about which fields it has (similar to facets in Dash). 
 * This allows each node to provide necessary
 * information to the "Add Node" feature, which
 * relies on knowing the fields a node can have so that a user 
 * can input them appropriately.
 * 
 * Essentially, a FieldDefinition describes a single user-editable field for a NodeStore.
 *
